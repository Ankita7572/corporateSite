                  Top PHP Programming Language Features You Should Know
                </h1>
                <p>
                  PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a general-purpose, server-side
                  programming language that is easy to integrate in HTML. A
                  scripting language is a sort of programming language that is
                  utilized during runtime. It may be used to construct plugins
                  and extensions, as well as administer systems, in addition to
                  automating task execution. It does not use web browsers;
                  rather, the applications built on it run on web servers. The
                  PHP programming language has numerous unique advantages since
                  it can execute any server-side programming work, including the
                  backend of any website page. The major goal of PHP design is
                  web development. Features of the PHP framework
