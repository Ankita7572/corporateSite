                  accessibility barriers Speaking in terms of telephony, PBX
                  refers to Private Branch eXchange. In todayâ€™s fast-paced and
                  competitive world, a PBX solution is vital for the success of
                  any business and to establish an identity in the corporate
                  world. Our PBX solutions help businesses and brands leverage
                  the power of cloud communication and get freedom from the
                  traditional line-based system of communication. At Incredere
                  Services, we offer a hosted IP PBX solution in the form of
                  software that can be used on-site without the need for any

                  The IP PBX is different from the traditional PBX systems. An
                  IP PBX involves a Private Branch eXchange that alternates
                  calls over the internet between VoIP (Voice Over Internet
                  Protocol) users. As your business grows, you can use the
                  flexible nature of the on-site PBX system as per the
                  requirements of your business. Our PBX solution is a one-stop
                  destination offering various collaboration tools for different
                  modes of communication: voice calls, video conferencing,
                  Instant Messaging (IM), and more. You are free to choose the
                  collaboration tool that works best for your business. The IP
                  PBX forms the core component of most modern-day telephony
                  systems. Hosted IP PBX solutions cost less and offer much
                  better call quality compared to traditional analog phone
                  lines.

                    Business call recordings work well to train new employees

                    Personalized agent feedback can be attached with the call
                    records to help employees improve their interaction. Clients
                    can have a complete call record repository with our IP PBX

                    The IP PBX system has a live call transfer feature that
                    makes it possible to transfer calls from one employee to
                    another within the organization, or to a phone outside the
                    premises as well. For example, a call from a customer can be
                    transferred to a technician who is on-field.

                    With the built-in multi-party conferencing feature, it is
                    possible to make a conference call with multiple members.
                    This means better collaboration among team members. The best
                    part about the multi-conferencing feature is that the call
                    quality over VoIP is maintained.

                    transcription feature that consists of a plain text-based
                    transcription along with the voicemail in audio format.

                    The hosted IP PBX solution designed and developed by us is
                    user-friendly. There is no need for an expert technician to

                    tech-savvy can install and configure our IP PBX system.
